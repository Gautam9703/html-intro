    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It allows web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages. CSS works by applying styles to HTML elements, enabling designers to create visually appealing and consistent designs across multiple web pages.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Why use CSS?
    </h2>
    <p>
        CSS is used to separate the content of a web page (HTML) from its presentation (CSS). This separation allows for greater flexibility and maintainability in web design. By using CSS, developers can easily change the look and feel of a website without modifying the underlying HTML structure. Additionally, CSS enables responsive design, allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Basic Syntax of CSS
    </h2>
    <p>
        CSS rules consist of selectors and declarations. A selector targets specific HTML elements, while declarations define the styles to be applied. Declarations are enclosed in curly braces and consist of property-value pairs. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        selector {
            property: value;
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
        Example:-
    </p>
    <pre>
        p {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 16px;
        }
    </pre>
    <h2>
        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
        CSS is a powerful tool for web designers and developers, allowing them to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. By mastering CSS, one can enhance the overall user experience and ensure that web pages are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

        What is External CSS?.
    </h2>
    <p>
        External CSS refers to the practice of defining CSS styles in a separate file with a .css extension, which is then linked to an HTML document using the <link> element. This approach allows for better organization and maintainability of styles, as multiple HTML files can share the same external CSS file. By using external CSS, developers can easily update the design of an entire website by modifying a single stylesheet, rather than having to change styles within each individual HTML file.
    </p>
    <H2>
        Benefits of External CSS
    </H2>
    <p>
        1. Separation of Concerns: External CSS separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making it easier to manage and maintain both aspects independently.
        <br>
        2. Reusability: A single external CSS file can be linked to multiple HTML documents, allowing for consistent styling across a website and reducing redundancy.
        <br>
        3. Faster Load Times: Browsers can cache external CSS files, which can lead to faster load times for subsequent page visits, as the stylesheet does not need to be re-downloaded.
        <br>
        4. Easier Collaboration: In team environments, designers and developers can work on the CSS file separately from the HTML, facilitating collaboration and version control.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How to Link External CSS    
    </h2>
    <p> 
        To link an external CSS file to an HTML document, use the <link> element within the <head> section of the HTML file. The <link> element should include the rel attribute set to "stylesheet" and the href attribute pointing to the location of the CSS file. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;   
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, "styles.css" is the name of the external CSS file that contains the styles to be applied to the HTML document.
    </p>
    <H2>
        Conclusion
    </H2>
    <p>
        External CSS is a powerful technique for managing the styles of web pages. By separating CSS from HTML, developers can create more organized, maintainable, and efficient web designs. Whether working on a small project or a large website, utilizing external CSS is a best practice that enhances the overall development process.

        What is Internal CSS?
    </H2>
    <p>
        Internal CSS refers to the practice of embedding CSS styles directly within an HTML document using the 
        <b>style </b> element, which is placed inside the <head> section. This method allows developers to define styles that apply only to the specific HTML document in which they are included. Internal CSS is useful for applying unique styles to a single page without affecting other pages on the website.
    </p>
    <H2>
        Benefits of Internal CSS    
    </H2>
    <p>     
        1. Page-Specific Styling: Internal CSS allows for styles that are unique to a particular HTML document, making it easy to customize the appearance of individual pages.
        <br>
        2. Quick Prototyping: For small projects or quick prototypes, internal CSS can be a convenient way to apply styles without the need for separate CSS files.
        <br>
        3. Easier Testing: Developers can quickly test and modify styles directly within the HTML file, which can be beneficial during the development process.
    </p>
    <H2>
        How to Use Internal CSS
    </H2>
    <p>
        To use internal CSS, include the  element within the head section of your HTML document. Inside the <b>style</b>
        element, you can define your CSS rules. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;style&gt;
                body {
                    background-color: lightblue;
                }
                h1 {
                    color: navy;
                    text-align: center;
                }
                p {
                    font-size: 16px;
                }
            &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, the styles defined within the <b>style </b> element will apply only to the HTML document in which they are included.
    </p>    
    <H2>
        Conclusion
    </H2>
    <p>
        Internal CSS is a useful technique for applying styles that are specific to a single HTML document. While it may not be ideal for larger projects due to maintainability concerns, it can be effective for small-scale applications, prototypes, or when unique page-specific styles are needed. By understanding how to use internal CSS, developers can enhance the visual presentation of their web pages efficiently.

        What is the color system in CSS?
    </h2>
        The color system in CSS refers to the various methods and formats used to define and represent colors in web design. CSS supports multiple color formats, allowing developers to choose the most suitable one for their needs. The most commonly used color formats in CSS include:
        <ul><li>
            Named Colors: CSS supports a set of predefined color names, such as "red," "blue," "green," "black," and "white." These names can be used directly in CSS to specify colors.
        </li><li>
            Hexadecimal Values: Colors can be defined using hexadecimal notation, which consists of a "#" followed by six hexadecimal digits. The first two digits represent the red component, the next two represent green, and the last two represent blue (e.g., #ff5733).
        </li><li>
            RGB Values: The RGB color model allows colors to be defined using the red, green,
            and blue components, each ranging from 0 to 255. The syntax is rgb(red, green, blue) (e.g., rgb(255, 87, 51)).
        </li><li>
            RGBA Values: Similar to RGB, but includes an alpha channel for transparency. The syntax is rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) (e.g., rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5)).
        </li><li>
            HSL Values: The HSL color model defines colors using hue, saturation, and lightness. The syntax is hsl(hue, saturation%, lightness%) (e.g., hsl(14, 100%, 60%)).
        </li><li>
            HSLA Values: Similar to HSL, but includes an alpha channel for transparency. The syntax is hsla(hue, saturation%, lightness%, alpha) (e.g., hsla(14, 100%, 60%, 0.5)).
        </li></ul>
    <h2>
        Red, Green, Blue
    </h2>
    <img src="Screenshot 2026-01-09 020541.png" alt=" rgb">
    <p>
        In addition to these formats, CSS also supports other color models and functions, such as the CSS Color Module Level 4, which introduces new color spaces like Lab and LCH. Understanding the color system in CSS is essential for creating visually appealing web designs and ensuring accessibility for users with different visual needs.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>left: Aligns the text to the left edge of the containing element (default for left-to-right languages).</li>
        <li>right: Aligns the text to the right edge of the containing element.</li>
        <li>center: Centers the text horizontally within the containing element.</li>
        <li>justify: Stretches the text so that it aligns with both the left and right edges of the containing element, creating a clean block of text.</li>
    </ul>
   
   
        This text is aligned to the left. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

    </p>
    <h2>What is the text decoration property in CSS?</h2>
    <p>
        The text-decoration property in CSS is used to specify the decoration added to text within an HTML element. It allows web developers to enhance the appearance of text by adding various styles, such as underlines, overlines, line-throughs, and more. The text-decoration property can take several values, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>none: Removes any text decoration (default value).</li>
        <li>underline: Adds a line below the text.</li>
        <li>overline: Adds a line above the text.</li>
        <li>line-through: Adds a line through the middle of the text, often used to indicate deleted or outdated content.</li>
        <li>blink: Makes the text blink (not widely supported and generally discouraged for usability reasons).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Example of text-decoration property in CSS:
    </p>
    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">
        This text is underlined.
    </p>
    <p style="text-decoration: overline;">
        This text has an overline.
    </p>
    <p style="text-decoration: line-through;">
        This text has a line through it.
    </p>
    <p style="text-decoration: none;">
        This text has no decoration.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using the text-decoration property, designers can improve the visual hierarchy and emphasis of text content on web pages, making it easier for users to identify important information and navigate through the content. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is the text transform property in CSS?</h2>
    <p>
        The text-transform property in CSS is used to control the capitalization of text within an HTML element. It allows web developers to modify the case of text without changing the actual content in the HTML. The text-transform property can take several values, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>none: No transformation is applied (default value).</li>
        <li>capitalize: Capitalizes the first letter of each word in the text.</li>
        <li>uppercase: Converts all characters in the text to uppercase.</li>
        <li>lowercase: Converts all characters in the text to lowercase.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Example of text-transform property in CSS:
    </p>
    <p style="text-transform: capitalize;">
        this text is capitalized.
    </p>
    <p style="text-transform: uppercase;">
        this text is in uppercase.
    </p>
    <p style="text-transform: lowercase;">
        THIS TEXT IS IN LOWERCASE.
    </p>
    <p style="text-transform: none;">
        This text has no transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using the text-transform property, designers can enhance the visual presentation of text content on web pages, ensuring that it aligns with the overall design and style of the site.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the font property in CSS?</h2>
    <p>
        The font property in CSS is a shorthand property used to set multiple font-related properties in a single declaration. It allows web developers to define the font style, variant, weight, size, line height, and family of text within an HTML element. The font property can include the following components:
    </p>

    <img src="Box modul .png" alt="box model" style="width: 400px;">
    <h2>What is the box model in CSS?</h2>
    <p>
        The box model in CSS is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are structured and rendered on a webpage. It consists of four main components:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content: The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.).</li>
        <li>Padding: The space between the content and the border.</li>
        <li>Border: The line that surrounds the padding and content.</li>
        <li>Margin: The space outside the border that separates elements from each other.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Example of box model in CSS:
    </p>
    <div class="boxmodel">
        This div has a width of 200px, height of 100px, padding of 10px, border of 5px solid black, and margin of 15px.
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
        Understanding the box model is essential for web designers and developers, as it helps them control the layout and spacing of elements on a webpage effectively.
    </p>
    <h3>WIDTH PROPERTY </h3>
    <p>
        The width property in CSS is used to specify the width of an HTML element. It allows web developers to control how wide an element appears on a webpage. The width can be defined using various units, such as pixels (px), percentages (%), ems (em), rems (rem), and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example of width property in CSS:
    </p>
    <div style="width: 300px; background-color: lightgray;">
        This div has a width of 300 pixels.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div style="width: 50%; background-color: lightblue;">
        This div has a width of 50% of its parent element.
    </div>
    <p>
        By using the width property, designers can create responsive layouts and ensure that elements are displayed correctly across different screen sizes and devices.
    </p>
    <h3>HIGHT PROPERTY</h3>
    <p>
        The height property in CSS is used to specify the height of an HTML element. It allows web developers to control how tall an element appears on a webpage. Similar to the width property, the height can be defined using various units, such as pixels (px), percentages (%), ems (em), rems (rem), and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example of height property in CSS:
    </p>
    <div class="height1">
        This div has a height of 150 pixels.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="height2">

    <p>
        The border radius property in CSS is used to round the corners of an HTML element's border. It allows web developers to create rounded corners on elements, enhancing the visual appeal and design of the webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example of border-radius property in CSS:
    </p>
    <div style="border-radius: 10px; border: 2px solid rgb(213, 89, 89); padding: 10px;">
        This div has a border radius of 10 pixels.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div style="border-radius: 50%; border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px;">
        This div has a border radius of 50 pixels.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div style="border-radius: 0px; border: 2px solid rgb(89, 153, 213); padding: 10px;">
        This div has a border radius of 0 pixels (sharp corners).
    </div>
    <p>
        By using the border-radius property, designers can create softer, more visually appealing elements on a webpage, contributing to a modern and user-friendly design.

    <h3>BORDER PROPERTY</h3>
    <p>
        The border property in CSS is used to define the border around an HTML element. It allows web developers to control the appearance of the border by specifying its width, style, and color. The border property can be applied to all four sides of an element (top, right, bottom, left) or to individual sides using specific properties like border-top, border-right, border-bottom, and border-left.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example of border property in CSS:
    </p>
    <div class="border1">
        This div has a solid black border with a width of 2 pixels.
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>
        The margin property in CSS is used to create space around an HTML element, outside of its border. It allows web developers to control the distance between elements on a webpage, helping to improve layout and visual separation. The margin property can be applied to all four sides of an element (top, right, bottom, left) or to individual sides using specific properties like margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example of margin property in CSS:

    <div class="margin2">
        This div has a margin of 10 pixels on the top and bottom, and 30 pixels on the left and right.
    </div>
    <p>
        By using the margin property, designers can create well-structured layouts, improve readability, and ensure that elements are displayed correctly across different screen sizes and devices.
    </p>
    <h3>PADDING PROPERTY</h3>
    <p>
        The padding property in CSS is used to create space inside an HTML element, between its content and its border. It allows web developers to control the amount of space between the content of an element and its border, helping to improve layout and visual separation. The padding property can be applied to all four sides of an element (top, right, bottom, left) or to individual sides using specific properties like padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example of padding property in CSS:
    </p>
    <div class="padding1">
        This div has a padding of 15 pixels on all sides.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="padding2">
        This div has a padding of 10% on the top and bottom, and 20% on the left and right.
    </div>
    <p>
        By using the padding property, designers can create well-structured layouts, improve readability, and ensure that elements are displayed correctly across different screen sizes and devices.
    </p>
    <h4>padding left, right, top, bottom</h4>
    <p>
        The padding-left, padding-right, padding-top, and padding-bottom properties in CSS are used to specify the amount of space (padding) on the respective sides of an HTML element. These properties allow web developers to control the spacing between the content of an element and its border on each individual side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example of padding-left, padding-right, padding-top, and padding-bottom properties in CSS:
    </p>
    <div class="padleft">
        This div has a padding of 30 pixels on the left side.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="padright">
        This div has a padding of 30 pixels on the right side.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="padtop">
        This div has a padding of 30 pixels on the top side.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="padbottom">
        This div has a padding of 30 pixels on the bottom side.
    </div>  
    <p>
        By using these individual padding properties, designers can create precise layouts and ensure that elements are displayed correctly across different screen sizes and devices.
    </p>
    <h4>BORDER-RADIUS PROPERTY</h4>
    <p>
        The border-radius property in CSS is used to add rounded corners to an HTML element. It allows web developers to control the shape of an element by specifying the radius of the corners. This property can be applied to all four corners of an element or to individual corners using specific properties like border-top-left-radius, border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-left-radius, and border-bottom-right-radius.
    </p>
