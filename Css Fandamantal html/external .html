        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It allows web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages. CSS works by applying styles to HTML elements, enabling designers to create visually appealing and consistent designs across multiple web pages.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Why use CSS?
    </h2>
    <p>
        CSS is used to separate the content of a web page (HTML) from its presentation (CSS). This separation allows for greater flexibility and maintainability in web design. By using CSS, developers can easily change the look and feel of a website without modifying the underlying HTML structure. Additionally, CSS enables responsive design, allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Basic Syntax of CSS
    </h2>
    <p>
        CSS rules consist of selectors and declarations. A selector targets specific HTML elements, while declarations define the styles to be applied. Declarations are enclosed in curly braces and consist of property-value pairs. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        selector {
            property: value;
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
        Example:-
    </p>
    <pre>
        p {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 16px;
        }
    </pre>
    <h2>
        Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
        CSS is a powerful tool for web designers and developers, allowing them to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites. By mastering CSS, one can enhance the overall user experience and ensure that web pages are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

        What is External CSS?.
    </h2>
    <p>
        External CSS refers to the practice of defining CSS styles in a separate file with a .css extension, which is then linked to an HTML document using the <link> element. This approach allows for better organization and maintainability of styles, as multiple HTML files can share the same external CSS file. By using external CSS, developers can easily update the design of an entire website by modifying a single stylesheet, rather than having to change styles within each individual HTML file.
    </p>
    <H2>
        Benefits of External CSS
    </H2>
    <p>
        1. Separation of Concerns: External CSS separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making it easier to manage and maintain both aspects independently.
        <br>
        2. Reusability: A single external CSS file can be linked to multiple HTML documents, allowing for consistent styling across a website and reducing redundancy.
        <br>
        3. Faster Load Times: Browsers can cache external CSS files, which can lead to faster load times for subsequent page visits, as the stylesheet does not need to be re-downloaded.
        <br>
        4. Easier Collaboration: In team environments, designers and developers can work on the CSS file separately from the HTML, facilitating collaboration and version control.
    </p>
    <h2>
        How to Link External CSS    
    </h2>
    <p> 
        To link an external CSS file to an HTML document, use the <link> element within the <head> section of the HTML file. The <link> element should include the rel attribute set to "stylesheet" and the href attribute pointing to the location of the CSS file. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;   
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, "styles.css" is the name of the external CSS file that contains the styles to be applied to the HTML document.
    </p>
    <H2>
        Conclusion
    </H2>
    <p>
        External CSS is a powerful technique for managing the styles of web pages. By separating CSS from HTML, developers can create more organized, maintainable, and efficient web designs. Whether working on a small project or a large website, utilizing external CSS is a best practice that enhances the overall development process.

        What is Internal CSS?
    </H2>
    <p>
        Internal CSS refers to the practice of embedding CSS styles directly within an HTML document using the 
        <b>style </b> element, which is placed inside the <head> section. This method allows developers to define styles that apply only to the specific HTML document in which they are included. Internal CSS is useful for applying unique styles to a single page without affecting other pages on the website.
    </p>
    <H2>
        Benefits of Internal CSS    
    </H2>
    <p>     
        1. Page-Specific Styling: Internal CSS allows for styles that are unique to a particular HTML document, making it easy to customize the appearance of individual pages.
        <br>
        2. Quick Prototyping: For small projects or quick prototypes, internal CSS can be a convenient way to apply styles without the need for separate CSS files.
        <br>
        3. Easier Testing: Developers can quickly test and modify styles directly within the HTML file, which can be beneficial during the development process.
    </p>
    <H2>
        How to Use Internal CSS
    </H2>
    <p>
        To use internal CSS, include the  element within the head section of your HTML document. Inside the <b>style</b>
        element, you can define your CSS rules. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;style&gt;
                body {
                    background-color: lightblue;
                }
                h1 {
                    color: navy;
                    text-align: center;
                }
                p {
                    font-size: 16px;
                }
            &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, the styles defined within the <b>style </b> element will apply only to the HTML document in which they are included.
    </p>    
    <H2>
        Conclusion
    </H2>
    <p>
        Internal CSS is a useful technique for applying styles that are specific to a single HTML document. While it may not be ideal for larger projects due to maintainability concerns, it can be effective for small-scale applications, prototypes, or when unique page-specific styles are needed. By understanding how to use internal CSS, developers can enhance the visual presentation of their web pages efficiently.

        What is the Collor Property in CSS?
    </h2 >
    <p>
        The color property in CSS is used to set the color of text content within HTML elements. It allows web developers to specify the color of text using various formats, such as named colors, hexadecimal values, RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values, HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values, and more. By using the color property, designers can enhance the visual appeal and readability of web pages by applying different colors to headings, paragraphs, links, and other text elements.

        How to Use the Color Property in CSS    
    </H2>
    <p>
        To use the color property in CSS, you can include it within a CSS rule that targets specific HTML elements. Here are some examples of how to apply the color property using different color formats:
    </p>
    <pre>
        /* Using named colors */
        p {
            color: blue;
        }

        /* Using hexadecimal values */
        h1 {
            color: #ff5733;
        }

        /* Using RGB values */
        a {
            color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
        }

        /* Using HSL values */
        h2 {
            color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%);
        }
    </pre>
    <p id="color-property">
        In these examples, the color property is applied to different HTML elements (paragraphs, headings, and links) using various color formats.
